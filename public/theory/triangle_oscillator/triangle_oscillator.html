<h1>The triangle oscillator - some theory and formulas</h1>
<p>
    On my blog, I did a rather thorough analysis of the super saw (saw animator, ultrasaw) circuit
    from the Minibrute/Maxibrute. I explained in general terms what blocks it's made up of and
    the theory behind what makes it able to phase shift a saw wave using a triangle wave as control.
</p>
<p>
    Now, I also wanted to build this circuit myself, to test it in a polyphonic synth. The only
    problem is that the Minibrute super saw triangle waves are controlled by in-circuit
    potentiometers, which means I would either have to have one potentiometer per voice, or an
    8-channel potentiometer, which of course is not feasible. I would have to change this into
    some form of voltage control. (I could of course replace the whole triangle wave circuit with
    a digital or analog LFO, but where's the fun in that...).
</p>
<p>
    [FACTS HERE]
    - frequency controlled only by R_integrator and C, and is independent of V_sat and V_supply
    - The amplitude is controlled only by the ratio between the resistors in the hysteresis part
    and is also independent of V_sat and V_supply.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, the only place where we have a potentiometer is between the two opamps. I could
    replace this with a voltage controlled resistor scheme, or I could try to understand exactly
    what it does and look for alternatives.
</p>
<p>
    So let's take a closer look at the circuit. It is actually rather simple. It consists of two
    main parts - a comparator with hysteresis and an integrator. The output of the integrator feeds
    back to the comparator, and whenever its output voltage crosses a predefined comparator voltage,
    the comparator output switches polarity. The comparator output in turn controls the integrator
    charging/discharging, and changing polarity flips from charging to discharging and vice versa.
    Let's see exactly what is going on.
    [PIC HERE]
</p>
<h2>The comparator</h2>
<p>
    The left opamp is configured as a comparator. It has its negative input tied to 0V, which means
    that whenever its positive input crosses 0V, its output will swing between the positive and
    negative opamp saturation voltages, $+/- V_{sat}$ (Close to but not necessarily equal to the
    supply voltages).
</p>
<p>
    But the positive input is not tied directly to the integrator output. Instead the output goes
    through a resitor. We also have a resistor between the comparator output and the positive
    comparator terminal (e.g. positive feedback as opposed to the negative feedback most often
    found in opamp based circuits). These resistors form what is called a hysteresis circuit.
</p>
<p>
    What it does it changing when the comparator output flips polarity. Instead of an instant flip
    when the input crosses the reference voltage, it 'delays' the flip until the voltage is a
    certain amount above or below the reference.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to note that the circuit input is now not AT the positive terminal, but rather
    before $R_1$. The voltage at the positive terminal is still at 0V (or actually, the same voltage
    as the negative terminal) when the comparator output flips. But how do we know exactly when the
    flip happens?
</p>
<p>
    Well, the two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ form a voltage divider between the integrator output
    $V_{int}$ and the comparator output ($V_{comp}). The center of this divider is connected to
    the positive terminal, $V_{pos}$.
</p>
<p>
    The formula for a resistor voltage divider is  \(V_{out} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{in}\)
    [FIGURE, NORMAL VOLTAGE DIVIDER]
</p>
<p>
    Normally when doing resistor divider calculators, we assume that the bottom of the divider is at
    0V. This is not the case for us, the bottom is at $V_{int}$. Our input and output voltages are
    thus:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(V_{in} = V_{int} - V_{comp}\)</li>
    <li>\(V_{out} = V_{pos} - V_{comp}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    This gives us: \(V_{pos} - V_{comp} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot (V_{int} - V_{comp})\)
</p>
<p>
    Right. But how does this help us figure out when the comparator flips? Well, we know this
    happens when the positive and negative comparator inputs are equal, and the negative input
    is tied to 0V. This means that the flip happens when $V_{pos}$ is 0V too. Entering this into the
    equation above, and solving for the integrator output voltage $V_{int}$ gives us:
</p>
<p>
    \(0 - V_{comp} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot (V_{int} - V_{comp})\)<br>
    \(-V_{comp} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{int} - \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot
    V_{comp}\)<br>
    \(\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{int} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{comp} -V_{comp}\)<br>
    \(\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{int} = \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{comp} -
    \frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{comp}\)<br>
    \(\frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{int} = \frac{-R_1}{R_1 + R_2} \cdot V_{comp}\)<br>
    \(R_2 \cdot V_{int} = -R_1 \cdot V_{comp}\)<br>
</p>
<p>
    and finally
</p>
<p>
    \(V_{int} = -\frac{R_1}{R_2} \cdot V_{comp}\)<br>
</p>
<p>
    which means that the comparator output polarity changes once $V_{int}$ has reached $-\frac{R_1}{R_2} \cdot V_{comp}$
</p>
<h2>The integrator</h2>
<p>
    The second part of the triangle oscillator is the integrator. It consists of a capacitor $C$, a
    resistor $R_{int}$ and an opamp. The capacitor is placed in the feedback loop of the opamp.
    The resistor and capacitor share a common terminal at the opamp's negative terminal, which is
    at virtual ground (0V). From the basic opamp 'laws' we know that any current that flows through
    the resistor and into the common terminal, also flows into the capacitor, charging it. [FIGURE]
</p>
<p>
    The left capacitor terminal is locked at 0V, so charging/discharing the cap changes the
    potential at the right terminal (or rather, the opamp rises it's output voltage to draw a
    continous current into the cap). The charging continues until the opamp cannot change its
    output anymore (it reaches its $V_{saturation}$) or charging is interrupted by changing the
    current through $R_{int}$.
</p>
<p>
    The current through $R_{int}$ is simply the output of the comparator divided by the resistance,
    \(I_{int} = \frac{+/-V_{comp}}{R_{int}}\)
</p>

    From my work on the VCO, we have that
